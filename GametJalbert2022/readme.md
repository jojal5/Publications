This program goes along with the paper of Gamet & Jalbert (2022) available *via* this [link](https://doi.org/10.1002/env.2744). This program defines the extended generalized Pareto distributions described in the paper and provides the code to reproduce the results.

Requirements : 
- Julia 1.6 and newer;
- Jupyter notebook.

<b>Note :</b> The Extremes.jl and ExtendedExtremes.jl libraries are currently being refactored. That's why the versions used in this notebook are different from those of the master branches.

## Code

The code is available in a Jupiter notebook with a Julia kernel. The principal file is *IDF_interpolation-Example.ipynb*. If GitHub has difficulties to render it for online viewing, you can paste the url in the following Jupyter viewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

To able the run the code, Julia 1.6 or newer should be installed along with the following Packages:

- CSV
- DataFrames
- Distributions
- ProgressMeter
